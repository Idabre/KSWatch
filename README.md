# KSWatch
This projects aims at providing an analysis of the digital influence of the ivorian rap musician KS Bloom. He openly assumes the ambition to provide the rap game with a dual-core model of message: the christian values (particularly demanding to the youth) wrapped into a pure urban style - both in lyrics and music style - pouring out from the ivorian contemporary subculture. In one album track, oddly and yet relevantly entitled "Intro", he states: "Si personne ne les côtoie, ils seront impactés comment ?", which I translate "If noone rubs shoulders with them, how will they be impacted ?". He talks about those among the people - especially the youth - who are not embracing his faith and its subsequent values. One may sum up this album project as an *impactation endeavour*. The KSWatch project here consists in trying to assess this fore-claimed impact quasi 9 months after not the album release, but the ideation phasis of the impactation campaign; thanks to an insider leak from a whatsapp group build-up for the impactation strategy ideation and implementation purpose.

This analysis is performed with considering a bunch of other mediatic KPI which already display at least a mediatic boom around the album and the artist: FB, IG, Tiktok followers, milions views on YT, Guest of preponderant TV/Web shows, etc. Here the aim is more precisely detect an (even weak) signal of a bloom occurring inside the cultural sphere targeted by the impactation endeavour. This is thus achieved by performing an analysis of the raw "gbahément" - talk - within this cultural sphere since then.
