    "\"Ce groupe est là à 100% pour le salut des âmes, mais comme les gens refusent d'entendre le pur évengile, l'évengile viendra vers eux de façon subtile, caché dans la musique de notre frère **KS Bloom** , c'est comme ça que nous pourrons les avoirs ! On va envahir la toile, on va faire un tapage énorme à la sortie de l'album pendant au moin une semaine ! Pour que le plus de personne l'écoute et reçoive l'évengile! C'est pour ça qu'on est tous là [smiley feu]\n",

    "\n",
    "\"This group is 100% about saving souls. But since people tend to not receive the raw gospel, this gospel will reach them subtly hidden inside the music of our brother **KS Bloom**. We'll get them into it this way! We'll overflow the web, making a lot of noise for the release of the album for one good week! This aims at letting the most people possible be exposed to the gospel through listening the music. This is the point here ! [smiley fire]\n",

    "Their URLs date back to the posts then: March 13th. Some days later, all 5 groups were on, according to the personal observation of a witness. Some of them require to be admitted though. But as of today (Nov 8th, 2021) only #4 and #5 do exist or have the same URL as before. It is not easy to spot whether #1 #2 and #3 are still alive, having been \"transferred\" to another host URL. \n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the observation of a witness some days after March 13th,\n",
    "#1 #2 and #3 are of the same kind, self-claiming a unique entertainment purpose. To a witness observation it gathered YOLO-minded young people who did posted dark, obscene or mocking content about other people, themselves and society. The main themes then observed are **humor**, **sex**, **gossip**, which we try to show through the E.D.A.\n",
    "#4 slightly steps aside the latter\n",
    "#5 promotes rap music made in Ivory Coast. It shares similar contents with the 4 others, but with a smaller quantity.\n",

    "\n",
    "**A first class of observations relates to the highlights of the life of the group itself.**\n",
    "\n",
    "On March 13th a first recall is released by uKB. It reminds all that the purpose of the group is not to chat & chill, but to promote the then incoming album \"Allumez La Lumière\". He then insists on the freedom to leave the game if one doesn't share the said purpose.  At this moment the discussion, when made possible by the group admins, tend to mainly turn around chatting between members about other subjects than promoting the album.\n",
    "\n",
    "On March 19th, a post probes on the pre-purchase of the album itself among the members.\n",
    "\n",
    "On March 23th, the user Mr Beckaine (uBK) gives a special annoucement about the release of the album and its availability on various streaming platforms.\n",

    "On March 14th and 15th, group members are thanked by uKB for having posted on the targeted groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "On March 15th, \n",
    "The user Mr Beckaine (uBK) asks all whether they are successful in flooding their social media with the content privately shared in the group, and thanks all about their various commitments. \n",
    "uKB requires the users to substitute a promotional picture for their profile picture to boost visibility on whatsapp.\n",
    "\n",
    "On March 19th,\n",
    "uKB reminds all to suscribe to the targeted groups. He then requires all to post their feelings and comments about the album on the targeted groups. A member is specially thanked for a facebook post which gets a lot of hits on FB.\n",
    "\n",
    "On March 24th,\n",
    "A member (which is known to be a member of the staff) posts to report that posts related to KS Bloom are blocked. He suggests to use one's FB profiles as ad supports.\n",
